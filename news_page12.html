          <p>In today’s competitive market, the accounting function needs to improve existing processes and, at times,
            infrastructure to achieve greater efficiency and accuracy. Faster closing gives an indication that the
            organization takes seriously its responsibility to report its financial position internally and externally.
          </p>
          <hr>

          <p>When properly implemented, sound financial processes will improve information and deliver accurate data to
            decision makers throughout the entire year, and early enough to take corrective action. <strong> Fast and
              effective closing saves time, money, resources and minimizes re-work.</strong></p>

          <p>The production of timely and accurate financial information is essential all year round, driving the
            need for systems, processes, and procedures to be in place that accommodate all financial activities
            throughout
            the financial calendar year such as year-end reporting, month end, annual budgeting,
            tax and audit preparation, product profitability analysis, and quarter- or mid-year re-forecasting.</p>
          <br>
          <h4><b>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</b></h4>
          <p>A faster year end close is a good indication of how well a company’s financial systems and procedures are
            performing. Fast and effective closing saves time, the time saved directly translates to time dedicated to
            performing value-added activities throughout the organization.</p>
          <p>Faster Year end close aids sound financial management, better resource management, lowers risk, informs
            stakeholders, motivates staff and reduces turnover.</p>

              CHALLENGES TO CLOSING FASTER
            </li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Lack of training:</b> Ensuring that staff are properly trained in the proper use of systems and
                procedures is an essential part of a faster close. Doing things right the first time is more efficient
                than reworking down the line. Training staff on year-end procedures is vital for new staff, but an
                annual refresher will also remind existing staff of how to properly perform required procedures. A
                training session is also a good place to remind staff of the latest corporate or government changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Passive support by senior management:</b> The support of senior management is crucial to the success
                or failure of a faster close. Without the support of senior staff to put systems in place, a faster
                close is out of the question. Staff will not understand the importance of a fast close, and the effort
                will be viewed as wasted time if management does not actively participate in the process.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Department buy-in:</b> A good performance management system provides tools that will benefit many
                departments outside of finance. When all departments use the same system, ultimately data becomes
                transparent and the creation of reports and performing analysis becomes painless as well as raises the
                overall quality of the information provided.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Inadequate systems:</b> Using a good system will mitigate the need to create detailed procedures
                manually and can automate many of the steps involved when creating year-end reports.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Failing to communicate:</b> Failing to engage with staff from across the organization, both in terms
                of seeking their input on how processes and working practices could change and not communicating to them
                throughout the project, will potentially lead to failure.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Poor communication with auditors:</b> There are benefits of holding regular progress meetings with
                auditors that are attended by senior management. These meetings ensure that any potentially contentious
                issues are discussed at an early stage.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </ul>
          </p>

              ACHIEVING A FASTER CLOSE
            </li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Improving financial control:</b> Having effective financial management controls in place is crucial
                to managing a business effectively. This same system of control also allows auditors to conduct their
                audits more efficiently. When auditors deem that the controls are operating properly, only small sample
                sets will be tested as opposed to thoroughly examining large samples of transactions. An important test
                of the financial control system is preparing monthly and quarterly statements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Developing the management reporting function:</b> Regular management reports have numerous
                advantages. Producing information throughout the year makes preparing the year-end reports easier, and
                it will also help departments track their resources and expenses throughout the year. This improved
                approach should, in turn, facilitate better decision making all year around. Up-to-date financial
                statements will also allow departments to re-allocate and re-prioritize their resources during the year
                to ensure corporate goals are met. This will not only benefit a faster close at year-end, but more
                effective management throughout the year as well as improved accuracy and efficiency.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Ensuring effective project management:</b> It is essential that each department manage their
                reporting projects effectively. Project planning should be part of the system used to manage and deliver
                year-end reports. Staff should be well briefed at the outset to ensure that expectations regarding the
                timeliness and quality of the information required are clear.

          <p>

            <li>
              BENEFITS OF A FASTER CLOSE
            </li>
            <ol>The benefits of a faster closing are summarized below:
              <li>
                Reliable financial information for users is available earlier knowing the real financial position allows
                management to make prompt, informed and effective decisions; and internal management can be better
                equipped in planning processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Weaknesses in financial systems can be identified and corrected at the earliest opportunity, and the
                preparation and audit of financial statements provides a major opportunity for building this assurance
                about financial records.
              </li>
              <li>
                Improvements in financial procedures and systems necessary for earlier closure can have a much wider
                benefit for the administration of the authority.
              </li>
              <li>
                The production of financial statements with an unqualified audit report provides everyone with assurance
                of good financial governance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Early compilation of the financial statements allows members and officers to concentrate on current-year
                financial matters and future plans.
              </li>
              <li>
                Early and effective publication of the statement of accounts is being promoted as a key indicator of
                good financial management.
              </li>
